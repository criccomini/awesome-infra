* [TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle) - TigerBeetle is a financial accounting database designed for mission critical safety and performance to power the future of financial services.

## OLAP Databases
*Online analytical processing databases.*

* [Materialize](https://materialize.com/) - Materialize is a data warehouse purpose-built for operational workloads where an analytical data warehouse would be too slow, and a stream processor would be too complicated.
* [Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/) - Apache Pinot is a distributed OLAP datastore, designed to answer OLAP queries with low latency.

## Search Engines
*Search engines.*

## Vector Stores
*Vector stores.*

* [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) - LanceDB is an open-source database that uses the Lance fileformat for vector-search.

## Data Lakes
*Data lakes.*

## Durable Execution
*Durable execution systems.*

## File Formats
*File formats.*

* [GraphAR](https://github.com/alibaba/GraphAr) - An open source, standard data file format for graph data storage and retrieval.
* [Lance](https://github.com/lancedb/lance) - Modern columnar data format for ML and LLMs implemented.

## Functions as a Service
*Functions as a service.*

* [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) - AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.
* [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) - Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services.
* [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) - Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.
* [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) - OpenFaaS makes it easy for developers to deploy event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes without repetitive, boiler-plate coding.
* [Knative](https://knative.dev/) - Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads.
* [Fission](https://fission.io/) - Fission is a framework for serverless functions on Kubernetes. It allows you to easily create HTTP services on Kubernetes from functions.
* [OpenLambda](https://github.com/open-lambda/open-lambda) - OpenLambda is an Apache-licensed serverless computing project, written (mostly) in Go and based on Linux containers.

## Workflow
*Workflow.*

* [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) - Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.
* [Prefect](https://prefect.io) - Prefect is a workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure and powered by the open-source Prefect Core workflow engine.
* [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) - Dagster is a data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL.

## Query Engines

* [Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) - Apache Calcite is a dynamic data management framework. It contains many of the pieces that comprise a typical database management system but omits the storage primitives.
* [Data Fusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) - DataFusion is a very fast, extensible query engine for building high-quality data-centric systems.
* [Substrait](https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait) - A cross platform way to express data transformation, relational algebra, standardized record expression and plans.
* [Velox](https://velox-lib.io/) - A C++ vectorized database acceleration library aimed to optimizing query engines and data processing systems.

## Service Mesh
*Service mesh.*

* [Istio](https://istio.io/) - IstIstio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies, and aggregate telemetry data.
* [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) - Linkerd is an ultralight, security-first service mesh for Kubernetes. Linkerd adds critical security, observability, and reliability features to your Kubernetes stack with no code change required.
